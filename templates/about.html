                <p>The story of Tailor's Thimble began over 50 years ago,
                    when founder Joe Gamberini became a tailor's apprentice
                    to his uncle. Their weeks started with a visit to the 
                    local fabric traders, sparking a lifelong passion in Joe 
                    for sourcing the finest materials for his tailoring.
                </p>
                <p>By the age of 17, Joe had ventured into running his own 
                    tailoring business, founding Tailor's Thimble in 1977.
                    Joe had developed a keen attention to detail in his work, 
                    from his sourcing of material through every stage of clothing
                    design and crafting. 
                </p>
                <p>Detail is key; this is a rule that has helped Tailor's Thimble
                    stand the test of time in both design and service for over
                    50 years.
